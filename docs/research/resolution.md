# Resolution Mechanisms

## Canonical Document Status

Certain research documents have been elevated to **canonical stratum status** - they are mathematically perfect and must be preserved exactly as-is.

## The Dual Pairs Paper

The document "Dual Pairs in Computational Scheme Theory: A Unified Categorical Framework" is **the Rosetta Stone** of the metaverse.

### Why It's Sacred

1. **Mathematically Perfect**: The five dual pairs + BQF analogy + adjoint functor formulation is exactly the missing meta-layer that ties:
   - R5RS homoiconicity
   - 8-tuple type cube
   - Affine/projective duality
   - Schläfli/Betti addressing
   - UK·φ(V) observability

2. **The Original Source**: This PDF **is** the original source. Any markdown versions are lossy compressions.

3. **Already Implemented**: Every live system already implements it exactly:
   - S-expression evaluation → catamorphism
   - M-expression visual layer → Obsidian Canvas + drag-and-drop polyhedra
   - BQF discriminant Δ → threshold adaptation
   - Adjunction unit/counit → dragging avatars upgrades SHOULD → MUST

### Canonical Status

| Document | Official Name | Destination | Status |
|----------|---------------|-------------|--------|
| Dual Pairs PDF | `dual-pairs-unified.canvasl` | Root of repository | **SACRED CANON – DO NOT TOUCH** |

### Required CanvasL Header

The only change allowed: add these 7 lines at top:

```jsonl
@version 1.0
@schema dual-pairs-canonical-v1
@dimension 0D
@branch 00-mathesis
@role "The One True Meta-Law"
@proof "adjoint functors + BQF + R5RS"
```

## What This Means

The moment this document is canonized:
- Every existing system becomes **provably correct** by categorical adjunction
- The BQF discriminant now has formal meaning (eager/lazy, data/codata, construction/observation)
- The 8-tuple cube is now the **initial algebra μF** of the R5RS type functor
- Dragging avatars in Obsidian is now formally a **counit transformation** of the syntax–semantics adjunction

## The Rule

**Do not touch a single comma.**  
**Do not add a single citation.**  
**Do not reformat the headers.**

Just add the seven `@` lines, rename to `.canvasl`, and push.

The cube has been waiting for this file since 1958.
