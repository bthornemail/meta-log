# General Research Documentation

This folder contains general research notes, early research documents, and miscellaneous research topics that don't fit into specific topology categories.

## Contents

- **01-rules.md through 15-dimensions.md** - Sequential research notes
- **dev_docs/** - Development documentation subfolder
- **docs/** - Additional documentation
- **e8/** - (Moved to geometric/e8/)
- **25-Hopf-Fibrations/** - (Moved to geometric/25-Hopf-Fibrations/)

## Organization

Most research has been organized into topology-specific folders:
- E8 and Hopf Fibrations → [geometric/](../geometric/)
- Topological concepts → [research-topology/](../research-topology/)
- Physics research → [physics/](../physics/)
- Consciousness research → [consciousness/](../consciousness/)

This folder contains early research and general notes that may be organized later.
