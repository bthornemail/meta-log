# Development Documentation

This directory contains development documentation organized by **system topology**—the layers and components of the Meta-Log Substrate System (MLSS).

## Organization by System Topology

The documentation is organized according to the MLSS architecture:

### Core Layers

- **[foundation/](foundation/)** - Binary Layer (CBS), Substrate Runtime, Content Addressing
- **[waveform/](waveform/)** - Waveform Layer, WDL, Signal Processing
- **[geometric/](geometric/)** - Geometric Layer (E8), Hopf Fibrations, Topology
- **[symbolic/](symbolic/)** - Symbolic Layer, Prolog, Datalog, R5RS

### Advanced Components

- **[qstar/](qstar/)** - Q* Optimality Engine, Decision Making
- **[vision/](vision/)** - Computer Vision Pipeline, Image Processing
- **[consciousness/](consciousness/)** - Consciousness Framework, Qualia, Awareness
- **[physics/](physics/)** - Computational Physics, Quantum States, QFT

### Integrated Systems

- **[autonomy-awareness/](autonomy-awareness/)** - Autonomous Behavior, Self-Monitoring, Reflection
- **[research-topology/](research-topology/)** - Topological Research, 3D Video, Media Interaction
- **[infrastructure/](infrastructure/)** - Setup, Testing, Integration, Federation

## Quick Navigation

### By Component

- **Starting a new feature?** Check the relevant topology folder
- **Looking for implementation details?** See component-specific folders
- **Need setup help?** See [infrastructure/](infrastructure/)
- **Research topics?** See [research-topology/](research-topology/)

### By Task

- **Implementation**: Component folders contain implementation guides
- **Testing**: See [infrastructure/](infrastructure/) for test documentation
- **Integration**: See [infrastructure/](infrastructure/) for integration plans
- **Research**: See [research-topology/](research-topology/) and component research folders

## File Naming Conventions

- `IMPLEMENTATION.md` - Implementation guides
- `RESEARCH-PLAN.md` - Research plans
- `STATUS.md` - Current status
- `SUMMARY.md` - Summary documents
- `README.md` - Component overviews

## Contributing

When adding new documentation:

1. **Place files in the appropriate topology folder** based on the component
2. **Use descriptive names** that indicate the content
3. **Add to component README** if creating a new component folder
4. **Update this README** if adding a new topology category
