# Quaternary Quadratic Forms (QQF)

## Overview

Quaternary Quadratic Forms (QQF) extend quadratic forms to four variables, connecting to quaternion algebras and providing 4D quadrality.

## Structure

A Quaternary Quadratic Form is:
```
q(x, y, z, w) = ax² + by² + cz² + dw² + cross terms
```

## Relation to Quaternion Algebras

QQF norms are quaternion algebra norms:
- **Hamilton's ℍ**: Norm x² + y² + z² + w² (universal QQF)
- **Four Squares Theorem**: Every positive integer is sum of four squares
- **Non-commutative**: Quaternion multiplication (ij = k, ji = -k)

## Applications

### 4D Autonomous Basis
- **A₄ Layer**: Uses QQF for self-sustaining operations
- **4-basis rotations**: Non-commutative operations
- **Quaternionic catamorphisms**: R5RS folds over non-commutative S-expressions

### FRBAC Delegation
- **4-basis derivations**: m/i/j/k paths
- **Asymmetric delegations**: ij ≠ ji for directional access
- **Norm classification**: Epistemic certainty products (KK·KU)

### 3D Rotations
- **Hamilton's ℍ**: 3D rotations in graphics
- **Babylon.js VR**: Agent orientations in swarms
- **Rotational invariance**: ML predictor uses quaternion norms

## Quadrality

QQF enables 4-way relationships:
- Four complementary perspectives
- Non-commutative operations
- Enhanced symmetry groups
