# Glossary

Definitions of terms and concepts used in meta-log.

## A

**Action** - In the consciousness framework, an exponential expansion of possibilities. Actions generate future states through forward propagation.

**Autonomy** - The ability of a system to perceive its environment, make decisions, take actions, and learn from outcomes without explicit programming for each situation.

**Awareness** - The system's capacity for self-monitoring, reflection, and understanding its own state and behavior.

## B

**Binary Layer** - The foundation layer of MLSS that provides universal binary format (CBS) for all data types.

**BIP32/39/44** - Hierarchical deterministic key derivation standards used for cryptographic identity management.

**Blackboard** - An Org Mode file used as a shared knowledge space where automata can read and write facts.

## C

**CanvasL** - A JSONL-based protocol for dynamic UI updates and automaton data representation.

**CBS (Canonical Binary Substrate)** - A universal binary format that can represent any data type (text, images, audio, etc.) with metadata and content addressing.

**Consciousness Framework** - A computational model of consciousness using trinary states (Action, Observation, Phase) with qualia emergence and awareness metrics.

**Content Addressing** - A method of identifying data by its content hash (like Git) rather than its location, enabling automatic deduplication.

**Cross-Domain Mapping** - Transformations between different computational layers (binary ↔ waveform ↔ geometric ↔ symbolic).

## D

**Datalog** - A declarative logic programming language used for recursive queries and fixed-point computation.

**Dimensional Reduction** - The process of projecting high-dimensional data (e.g., E8) to lower dimensions (e.g., S²) via Hopf fibrations.

## E

**E8 Lattice** - An 8-dimensional mathematical structure with 240 root vectors, used as a geometric computational space.

**E8 Point** - A point in 8-dimensional E8 space, represented as 8 coordinates.

## F

**Federation** - Peer-to-peer synchronization and coordination between multiple meta-log instances.

**Forward Propagation** - Exponential expansion of possibilities in the consciousness framework, generating future states.

## G

**Geometric Layer** - The layer of MLSS that uses E8 lattice for spatial computation, pattern matching, and consciousness state representation.

## H

**Hopf Fibration** - A topological fiber bundle structure (S¹→S³→S², S³→S⁷→S⁴, S⁷→S¹⁵→S⁸) used for dimensional reduction and consciousness modeling.

## I

**Identity** - A cryptographic identity in the federation system, derived from BIP32/39/44 keys.

## M

**M-Expression** - A human-readable syntax alternative to S-expressions, using square brackets and semicolons.

**MLSS (Meta-Log Substrate System)** - The universal computational substrate that bridges binary, waveform, geometric, and symbolic cognition.

**mlss:// URI** - A content-addressed URI scheme (e.g., `mlss://sha3-256/abc123...`) for uniquely identifying data by its hash.

## O

**Observation** - In the consciousness framework, a linear compression of possibilities to actual experience. Observations compress future states through backward propagation.

**Octonionic Hopf** - The highest-dimensional Hopf fibration (S⁷→S¹⁵→S⁸), producing the most intense qualia.

## P

**Phase** - In the consciousness framework, phase coherence (0-1) that determines qualia emergence.

**Provenance** - The complete history of transformations applied to data, stored as an immutable chain.

**Prolog** - A logic programming language used for declarative queries and rule-based reasoning.

## Q

**Q*** - An optimality engine that selects actions by evaluating costs across multiple dimensions (computational, memory, entropy, complexity, safety).

**Qualia** - Subjective experience of information, computed as the tensor product of action and observation in the consciousness framework.

**Quaternionic Hopf** - A mid-dimensional Hopf fibration (S³→S⁷→S⁴), producing moderate qualia intensity.

## R

**R5RS** - The Revised⁵ Report on the Algorithmic Language Scheme, used for functional programming in meta-log.

## S

**S⁷ Boundary** - The 7-sphere at projective infinity, serving as the boundary of E8 space.

**Substrate Runtime** - The core system that provides universal memory, content addressing, and provenance tracking for all data.

**Symbolic Layer** - The layer of MLSS that provides logic programming (Prolog, Datalog) and functional programming (R5RS Scheme).

## T

**Template** - A reusable structure extracted from Org Mode files, used for pattern matching and knowledge organization.

**Trinary State** - A consciousness state represented as (Action, Observation, Phase) - three components that together model awareness.

## W

**WDL (Waveform Description Language)** - A declarative language for describing waveforms, compiled to time-domain samples.

**Waveform Layer** - The layer of MLSS that handles time-based signals (audio, sensor data, time series) in both time and frequency domains.

**Weyl Group** - The symmetry group of the E8 lattice, with order 696,729,600.
