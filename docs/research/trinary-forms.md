# Trinary Quadratic Forms (TQF)

## Overview

Trinary Quadratic Forms (TQF) extend Binary Quadratic Forms to three variables, providing a 3D analog of the BQF duality classification.

## Structure

A Trinary Quadratic Form is:
```
q(x, y, z) = ax² + by² + cz² + dxy + exz + fyz
```

## Discriminant

The discriminant extends the BQF discriminant to classify 3D forms:
- **Definite**: Stable 3D structures
- **Indefinite**: Dynamic 3D behaviors

## Applications

### 3D Manifold Classification
- **Definite TQF**: Stable 3D computational manifolds
- **Indefinite TQF**: Dynamic 3D projective spaces

### Triality
TQF enables triality relationships (3-way duality) beyond the 2-way duality of BQF:
- Three complementary perspectives
- Cyclic relationships
- Enhanced symmetry

## Relation to BQF

TQF generalizes BQF:
- BQF: 2D duality (affine/projective)
- TQF: 3D triality (three complementary views)
